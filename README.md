#### Hi, I'm Joaquín 👋

I'm a Business Intelligence professional with a background in international management and economics.
I bring a strong foundation in data science, analytics, and data engineering, and I'm currently based in Madrid.

My career began in sales and customer success, where I consistently used analytics to uncover insights and develop strategies that optimized client performance and delivered value.

A passion for programming sparked early in my journey and has driven me to work on a wide range of data science and analytics projects. I use Python, SQL, APIs, machine learning, dashboards, and cloud tools to turn data into impactful solutions.

And many more... 💼
